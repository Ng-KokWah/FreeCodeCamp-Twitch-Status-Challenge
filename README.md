# FreeCodeCamp-Twitch-Status-Challenge


This contains a website that shows whether some of the twitch channels: 
["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]
are streaming, and the content they are streaming.

It also allows you to go to their channels by clicking on their names.

This was coded for the FreeCodeCamp Twitch Status Challenge using the Twitch.tv JSON API.
